    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a simple recipe for how to make classic crepes. Crepes are a very thin pancake that originate from France.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, water, and salt together in a large mixing bowl; add flour and butter and whisk vigorously until smooth.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
